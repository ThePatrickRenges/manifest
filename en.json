Those who oppress are imprisoned themselves. And those who benefit while others suffer live a lie.",
  "intro2": "<strong>A world in which humans don’t live in harmony is built on a wrong foundation.</strong><br>The root of our society is poisoned – by capitalism, nationalism, dogma, and hierarchies.<br>We don't need reform. We need a radical rethink. A new beginning.",
